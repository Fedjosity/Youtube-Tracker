# Changes Summary

## Admin Role Reversion Fix

### Problem

Every time an admin user signed in, their role was being reverted from "admin" to "editor" due to the auth callback route always setting the role to "editor" on every sign-in.

### Solution

1. **Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts`**: Modified the upsert logic to preserve existing roles instead of always setting them to "editor"
2. **Created new migration `20250103000006_fix_admin_role_preservation.sql`**: Added a `safe_profile_upsert` function that checks if a profile exists and has admin role before updating
3. **Modified auth callback**: Now uses the new `safe_profile_upsert` function to safely handle profile updates without overwriting admin roles

### Key Changes

- Auth callback now checks if profile exists before setting role
- New database function `safe_profile_upsert` preserves admin roles
- Admin users can now sign in multiple times without losing their role

## Chart Components Refactoring

### Problem

Chart components were using inconsistent styling and default tooltips that didn't match the ShadCN design system.

### Solution

1. **Created `components/ui/chart-container.tsx`**: New ShadCN-styled container component for all charts
2. **Created `components/ui/chart-tooltip.tsx`**: New ShadCN-styled tooltip component for chart interactions
3. **Refactored all chart components** to use the new wrapper components

### Components Updated

- `components/analytics/analytics-charts.tsx` - LineChart with ShadCN styling
- `components/dashboard/weekly-chart.tsx` - BarChart with ShadCN styling
- `components/analytics/contribution-share.tsx` - PieChart with ShadCN styling
- `components/analytics/channel-metrics.tsx` - Metrics cards with ShadCN styling

### Key Improvements

- Consistent ShadCN design language across all charts
- Better color scheme using CSS variables (--primary, --success, etc.)
- Improved tooltip styling with proper ShadCN classes
- Better responsive design and accessibility
- Consistent loading states and error handling

## Console Log Cleanup

### Problem

Multiple console.log statements were scattered throughout the codebase for debugging purposes.

### Solution

- Removed all `console.log` statements from production code
- Kept `console.error` statements for proper error logging
- Cleaned up debug output while maintaining error tracking

### Files Cleaned

- `components/landing-page.tsx`
- `middleware.ts`
- `components/admin/system-settings-form.tsx`
- `app/api/submissions/route.ts`
- `components/overview/overview-table.tsx`
- `components/submissions/submission-detail.tsx`
- `test-submission.js` (deleted entirely)

## Technical Details

### Database Changes

- New function: `safe_profile_upsert(user_id, user_email, user_full_name, user_avatar_url)`
- Function automatically detects admin users and preserves their role
- Only new users get the default "editor" role

### Styling Improvements

- Charts now use `hsl(var(--primary))`, `hsl(var(--success))` for consistent theming
- Loading states use `bg-muted` instead of hardcoded colors
- Text colors use semantic classes like `text-muted-foreground`, `text-foreground`
- Grid lines use `stroke-muted` for better visual hierarchy

### Component Architecture

- `ChartContainer`: Provides consistent card styling with title/description support
- `ChartTooltipContent`: Custom tooltip with ShadCN design system
- All charts maintain their original functionality while improving visual consistency

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Role Test**: Sign in as admin multiple times to verify role preservation
2. **Chart Functionality**: Verify all charts still work correctly with new styling
3. **Responsive Design**: Test charts on different screen sizes
4. **Theme Consistency**: Verify ShadCN styling is applied consistently across the app
